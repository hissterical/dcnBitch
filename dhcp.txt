Sure, here's a concise list of all DHCP lab questions with direct answers and how to find them in Wireshark:

a) DHCP uses UDP
How: Check the "User Datagram Protocol" layer → source port 68, dest port 67

b) Link-layer (Ethernet) address of your host
How: In DHCP Discover → "Ethernet II" layer → Source = your MAC address

c) Difference between Discover and Request
How: In "Bootstrap Protocol" → DHCP Message Type option → Discover = 1, Request = 3

d) Transaction ID values
How: In each DHCP message → Bootstrap Protocol → Transaction ID field. All 4 (Discover, Offer, Request, ACK) share the same ID. Next round uses a new ID. Used to match requests with responses.

e) IPs used in Discover/Offer/Request/ACK
How: In IP layer of each packet:
Discover: Source 0.0.0.0, Dest 255.255.255.255
Offer: Source = server IP, Dest = 255.255.255.255
Request: Source 0.0.0.0, Dest 255.255.255.255
ACK: Source = server IP, Dest = client IP

f) DHCP server IP address
How: In DHCP Offer or ACK → Option 54: DHCP Server Identifier

g) IP address offered to client
How: In DHCP Offer → "Your (client) IP address" field

h) Presence of relay agent
How: In DHCP messages → giaddr (gateway IP) field
If 0.0.0.0 → No relay agent

i) Lease time and purpose
How: In DHCP Offer or ACK → Option 51: Lease Time
Purpose: How long client keeps the IP before renewal

j) Purpose of DHCP Release and ACK
Answer: DHCP Release tells server to give up IP. Server does not ACK the release.

k) Purpose of router and subnet mask options
Answer: Router = default gateway; Subnet Mask = client's network range
How: In DHCP Offer → Options 1 (Subnet Mask) and 3 (Router)

l) ARP messages during DHCP?
How: Remove filters → apply "arp" filter
Yes, ARP used to resolve MAC addresses or check IP availability
